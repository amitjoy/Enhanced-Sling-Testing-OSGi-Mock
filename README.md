# Enhanced-Sling-Testing-OSGi-Mock

This is an enhanced version of Apache Sling Testing OSGi Mock utility to provide mock implementations of OSGi API for easier testing. The actual utility library is very tightly coupled to Apache Sling and Apache Felix libraries.

This is the reason, this project has been started to remove all these dependencies so that this can be available as a standalone bundle.
